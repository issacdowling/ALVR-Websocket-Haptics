# ALVR Websocket Haptics
Receives haptic events from ALVR over a websocket connection using an ESP8266, triggers a connected haptic motor. Useful for augmenting / replacing broken controller haptics (such as with the Pico 4) 

This project was never "finished", or cleaned up, however it was gotten into a somewhat working state before I switched headsets, so it may be useful for somebody.
